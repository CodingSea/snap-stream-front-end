# Snap Stream

## Introduction

This project is a web-based Instagram clone, developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. It replicates Instagram’s core features, including user profile creation, image posting, as well as liking and commenting on posts.

## Project Brief

The purpose of this site is to allow users to post images and view posts from others, with a focus on delivering an improved user experience compared to the previous implementation. While the core concept remains the same as the earlier project, this version is built with React.js for the frontend and Django REST Framework for the backend.

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript ES6
* Git
* dotenv

## Wins and Blockers

**Wins include:**

* I managed to upload images to Cloudinary and utilised queries to get the necessary data from the database.
* I used a JWT for the login system, which improved the security of the website, allowing only for logged-in users to access some pages.

**Blockers include:**

* I struggled with using PostgreSql since I lacked the experience in SQL databases, but it was a great learning experiance.

## Future Features

* Mobile-friendly design and layout
* Video support
* Upload multiple images/videos in a post.
* Profile customizations

## In Conclusion

Overall, this project has been an enjoyable experience and provided many valuable learning opportunities. While I am not entirely satisfied with the current state of the website—particularly since I was unable to implement new features compared to my earlier attempt—I believe it still establishes a solid foundation for an Instagram clone. This version adopts a design that more closely resembles a real-world application.
